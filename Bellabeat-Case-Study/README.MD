# Bellabeat Case Study

## Introduction
Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in themglobal smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smartdevice fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. 
This analyze helps to answers following questions:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
   
I use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius)
